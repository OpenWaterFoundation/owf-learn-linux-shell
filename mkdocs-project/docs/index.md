# Learn / Linux Shell #

This documentation provides resources to learn how to use the Linux shell,
which provides an interactive command line environment and ability to automate tasks with shell scripts.
Linux shell scripts are useful for memorializing computational steps and automating repetitive tasks.
Linux shells are of course available on Linux computers and are also available on Windows.
Anyone that desires to automate data processing tasks should consider using Linux shell scripts.

More advanced programming can be performed with other languages.
Python is recommended given its ease of use, popularity, and functionality.
However, even when a programming language could be used to write a software program,
the Linux shell is still useful for ad hoc tasks such as searching and reformatting files
and stringing together computation tasks using existing programs.

This documentation has been written based on experience using Linux shells at the Open Water Foundation.

## About the Open Water Foundation ##

The [Open Water Foundation](http://openwaterfoundation.org) is a 501(c)3 nonprofit social enterprise that focuses
on developing and supporting open source software for water resources, so that organizations can make better decisions about water.
OWF also works to advance open data tools and implementation.
OWF has created this documentation to educate its staff, collaborators, and clients that use Linux shells.
