# Learn Linux Shell / Troubleshooting #

Troubleshooting shell scripts typically involves reviewing error messages printed by the shell program.
Often a line number will be printed indicating the location of the error.
Other troubleshooting tricks include:

* Redirect the output from the program to a file.
* Use the `-x` command parameter to run the shell script.
* Add `echo` commands in the shell script to print variables at intermediate steps.
